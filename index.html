            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Individuals with low levels of literacy are more likely to experience
                poorer employment
                opportunities and outcomes and lower income. As a result, they often face welfare dependency, low
                self-esteem, and higher levels of crime. Illiteracy has many interrelated causes and effects.... Thus,
                one
                could easily argue that the increase in literacy is directly correlated with positive economic growth.
                In the past, education
                was not required, but in this day, universal education is becoming a necessity.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Technology ushers in fundamental structural changes that can be integral
                to achieving significant improvements in productivity. Used to support both teaching and learning,
                technology infuses classrooms with digital learning tools, such as computers and hand held devices;
                expands course offerings, experiences, and learning materials; supports learning 24 hours a day, 7 days
                a week; builds 21st century skills; increases student engagement and motivation; and accelerates
                learning. Technology also has the power to transform teaching by ushering in a new model of connected
                teaching. This model links teachers to their students and to professional content, resources, and
                systems to help them improve their own instruction and personalize learning.<br>

                Online learning opportunities and the use of open educational resources and other technologies can
                increase educational productivity by accelerating the rate of learning; reducing costs associated with
                instructional materials or program delivery; and better utilizing teacher time.</p>
